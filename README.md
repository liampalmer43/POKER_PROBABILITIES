# POKER_PROBABILITIES
In probabilities.cc we developed a subset algorithm to determine the subsets of size five of a collection of seven objects.  We used the property that each choice of five elements from this group of 7 corresponds to a 7 digit binary number with 5 ones in it's binary expansion.  Note that we allow leading zeros since "0011111" would correspond to choosing the last five elements of the group of seven.  This algorithm allows us to construct subsets of five directly and nonrecursively.  To find the numbers in our range with 5 ones in their binary expansion the function "FiveOnes(int i)" simply mods out by 2 repeatedly and keeps track of the results (see implementation).  For example, FiveOnes(31)=True since 31 = 11111, FIveOnes(62)=True since 62 = 111110 but FiveOnes(5)=False since 5 = 101 in binary.
